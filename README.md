### Json file with little details about the DSC UBa members

First and foremost, fork this repository.

All you have to do is add your membership details to the members.json file. A template is provided as the first input in the array. Copy and paste it underneath the last item of the array. Finally, edit what you pasted as follows:
* For the "id" value, replace "5" with the id value of the last item of the list plus 1 (this will be considered as your member id)
* For the "name" value, replace "Betty" with your name.
* For the "position" value, replace "Core Team Member" with your membership status at DSC (Lead, Co-lead, Core Team Member, Member)
* For the "language" value, replace "JavaScript" with your favourite programming language.
* For the "level" value, replace "Novice" ,with your skill level in your favourite programming language (novice, beginner, intermediate, expert)

Make sure you put a comma before pasting. Once you are done, commit your changes and create a pull request:)
